#  Survey: School Principals

## Principals for all K-6 schools within the five identified school districts

In an effort to understand the current state of arts education in K-6th grades throughout the Sacramento Region, we surveyed all principals serving in K-8th grade schools across the following five school districts: Robla, Sacramento County, Twin Rivers, Elk Grove, and Natomas. Principals (or school-level leads) were asked various questions about current availability of arts education, barriers to arts education, and quantity of opportunities provided to students. In total, there was a 55% survey completion rate across all districts (78 responses) as detailed below:.
  
| District | Total Schools | Total Participated | Percent  |
| -------  |:-------------:|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Elk Grove USD | 42 | 15 | 35.71% |
| Robla USD | 5 | 5 | 100% |
| Twin Rivers USD | 28 | 19 | 67.86% |
| Natomas USD | 12 | 11 | 91.67% |
| Sacramento City USD | 54 | 28 | 51.85% |


## Key Findings from the survey:
1. Most principals reported non-arts instructors provide arts opportunities or exposure within their classrooms, but a much smaller percentage are offered on-going training opportunities for this type of instruction. Increasing this type of teacher training could be an “easy win” with BIG classroom outcomes.

2. Most principals are contracting with outside providers, but providers have indicated (in the nonprofit survey) that they have no easy way to connect with schools sites or districts. A consistent method for connecting arts providers with schools could be a powerful tool.

3. Many indicated there were not ample supplies for arts instruction. Increasing availability of supplies may increase arts opportunities for students as provided by non-arts instructors.

4. Most schools in the school districts surveyed provide a very limited number of art exposure experiences. These experiences come in the form of field trips and assemblies and vary in number not only between the districts, but also within the districts themselves. Also, because the frequency of the exposures varies, some students may or may not have the opportunity to these experiences. It was reported by all districts that arts exposure experiences vary by individual teacher and by grade level. Among those surveyed, the after-school programs played a significant role in providing arts exposure experiences, thus limiting access to those who are part of after school programs.
  * a. Types of programming include Firefly Arts, ASES, START & PTA programs. Recurring programs across districts were Fire fly Arts and ASES. At least three school districts (EGUSD, NUSD, SCUSD) are utilizing firefly art for after school arts opportunities. EGUSD, SCUSD and TRUSD are using ASES programming.
  
5. Funding is not only seen as a barrier to increasing arts education, but was also chosen as the most important action to do so.

6. Students have opportunities to experience visual arts, dance, performing arts, and music across all the districts. However, Visual Arts and Music are offered more than twice as much as Dance and Theater.

## Detailed Survey Data and Analysis

**Designated Arts Coordinator**: Across all five districts, roughly 1/3 of schools that responded to our survey have a designated arts coordinator, while 2/3 do not. Among schools in TRUSD, that data is flipped, with 3⁄4 of schools having a designated arts coordinator and just 1⁄4 do not. SCUSD had the lowest rate of designated arts coordinators at schools, with just 3% of schools responding to our survey claiming they had such a role.

| Percentage by District | Responses | Yes | No |
| ---------------------  |:---------:|:---:|:--:|
| Robla USD | 5 | 100% | 0% |
| Twin Rivers USD | 20 | 75% | 25% |
| Unspecified | 22 | 45% | 55% |
| Natomas USD | 11 | 27% | 73% |
| Elk Grove USD | 15 | 13% | 87% |
| Sacramento City USD | 30 | 3% | 97% |

We posed several questions to understand how often non-arts instructors were given the opportunity to incorporate arts exposure experiences within their classrooms. We also asked about ongoing training opportunities and professional development opportunities for non-arts instructions.
     
Respondents also rated the availability of equipment, supplies and facilities for arts instruction or exposure for their schools:
              
Principals were asked to describe, on average, how many students at their school in grades K-6 were provided arts exposure during the school day. They were asked to describe these opportunities. Arts exposure for the purpose of this survey was defined as an experience outside formal arts instruction that incorporates purposeful experience and engagement with arts (i.e. performances, field trips, in-class arts projects, etc.).

Principals responded to how many days per week arts instruction classes are offered during the school year:

Principals were asked to cite biggest barriers to increasing arts education opportunities at their school

General Trend:
Of the 86 who answered, Funding was viewed as the #1 barrier to increasing arts education. Robla Unified and Twin Rivers Unified had 0% of their reporting schools chose Support from Administrator as a barrier.
