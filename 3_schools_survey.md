## Survey: School Principals



Principals for all K-6 schools within the five identified school districts
In an effort to understand the current state of arts education in K-6th grades throughout the Sacramento Region, we surveyed all principals serving in K-8th grade schools across the following five school districts: Robla, Sacramento County, Twin Rivers, Elk Grove, and Natomas. Principals (or school-level leads) were asked various questions about current availability of arts education, barriers to arts education, and quantity of opportunities provided to students. In total, there was a 55% survey completion rate across all districts (78 responses) as detailed below:.

Key Findings from the survey:
1. Most principals reported non-arts instructors provide arts opportunities or exposure within their classrooms, but a much smaller percentage are offered on-going training opportunities for this type of instruction. Increasing this type of teacher training could be an “easy win” with BIG classroom outcomes.
2. Most principals are contracting with outside providers, but providers have indicated (in the nonprofit survey) that they have no easy way to connect with schools sites or districts. A consistent method for connecting arts providers with schools could be a powerful tool.
3. Many indicated there were not ample supplies for arts instruction. Increasing availability of supplies may increase arts opportunities for students as provided by non-arts instructors.
4. Most schools in the school districts surveyed provide a very limited number of art exposure experiences. These experiences come in the form of field trips and assemblies and vary in number not only between the districts, but also within the districts themselves. Also, because the frequency of the exposures varies, some students may or may not have the opportunity to these experiences. It was reported by all districts that arts exposure experiences vary by individual teacher and by grade level. Among those surveyed, the after-school programs played a significant role in providing arts exposure experiences, thus limiting access to those who are part of after school programs.
a.
  Types of programming include Firefly Arts, ASES, START & PTA programs.
 Recurring programs across districts were Fire fly Arts and ASES. At least three
 school districts (EGUSD, NUSD, SCUSD) are utilizing firefly art for after school
  arts opportunities. EGUSD, SCUSD and TRUSD are using ASES programming
 .
5. Funding is not only seen as a barrier to increasing arts education, but was also chosen as
the most important action to do so.
6. Students have opportunities to experience visual arts, dance, performing arts, and music
across all the districts. However, Visual Arts and Music are offered more than twice as much as Dance and Theater.
for after school arts opportunities

 Detailed Survey Data and Analysis
Designated Arts Coordinator: Across all five districts, roughly 1/3 of schools that responded to our survey have a designated arts coordinator, while 2/3 do not. Among schools in TRUSD, that data is flipped, with 3⁄4 of schools having a designated arts coordinator and just 1⁄4 do not. SCUSD had the lowest rate of designated arts coordinators at schools, with just 3% of schools responding to our survey claiming they had such a role.
We posed several questions to understand how often non-arts instructors were given the opportunity to incorporate arts exposure experiences within their classrooms. We also asked about ongoing training opportunities and professional development opportunities for non-arts instructions.

Principals were asked to describe, on average, how many students at their school in grades K-6 were provided arts exposure during the school day. They were asked to describe these opportunities. Arts exposure for the purpose of this survey was defined as an experience outside formal arts instruction that incorporates purposeful experience and engagement with arts (i.e. performances, field trips, in-class arts projects, etc.).

This play will help Departments move from conversation to action. It will provide resources that will allow the Departments to succeed. This might include: roles and responsibilities; governance structures; and data standards.

This play will also include resources on project management and change management to help both staff implement and leadership enforce the importance of this work.

>This Play moves away from the **theoretical** and drives toward the **tactical**.

By detailing all critical steps before starting the project, the Department can anticipate factors  they otherwise would not consider until encountered and identify potential problems and challenges on the front end. 

The planning becomes proactive instead of reactive, which allows best practices to be used and ensures that energy and time are spent on implementing a high-quality, well‐thought‐out project rather than "putting out fires."

![Solutions]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/03_figure01.png "Solutions")

The planning and implementation processes will allow any person working on the project, regardless of his or her level of involvement, to fully understand the goal of the project and how it is to be accomplished. It ensures that everyone working on the project is on the same page and that any discrepancies are resolved before they become costly to the project or population served.

>This play will also include various **resources designed** to help with project management and data management. 

![How do you share data?]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/03_figure03.png "How do you share data?")

>Departments will work to identify Data Sharing and Data De-Identification best practices and lessons learned. 

The **Project Management Resources** will include resources on: agile planning and development; resource management; training; communication; and governance.  

The **Data Management Resources** will include resources on: data access and publishing; data standards; data documentation; and data tools and analytics.

### Data De-Identification Guidelines
 
CHHS collects, manages, and disseminates a wide range of data. As departments classify data tables and catalog their publishable state data, they should be mindful of legal and policy restrictions on publication of certain kinds of data. The CHHS Data Subcommittee commissioned the development of Agency-wide data de-identification guidelines to assist departments in assessing data for public release. 

The [CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines](https://github.com/chhsdata/dataplaybook/raw/gh-pages/documents/CHHS-DDG-V1.0-092316.pdf "CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines") support CHHS governance goals to reduce inconsistency of practices across departments, align standards used across departments, facilitate the release of useful data to the public, promote transparency of state government, and support other CHHS initiatives, such as the [CHHS Open Data Portal](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/ "CHHS Open Data Portal").
