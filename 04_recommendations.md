# Recommendations

Rooted in the above findings and driven by a design thinking workshop and internal brainstorm sessions, the NELP fellows recommend the launch of the Arts for ALL, a comprehensive approach for arts education in Sacramento consisting of three key drivers:

* **ALIGN** – bring together the arts providers, districts, schools, students, and community to improve communication throughout the region and foster a true arts education movement in the Sacramento area.

* **LEVERAGE** – better utilize the region’s existing resources and efforts to improve issues surrounding access and equity in arts education and exposure.

* **LEARN** – empower the region to think evermore expansively and creatively about how it can best serve Sacramento-area students in regards to arts education and exposure.

Recognizing that funds and resources are limited, the NELP fellows have created tiers of recommendations that will help the city and districts clarify their investment priorities:

**Tier 1** - Most impactful recommendation based on data and research. These recommendations will require a high level of resources and work effort in order to implement.

**Tier 2** – Moderate level of resources and work effort involved to implement.

**Tier 3** – Low level of resources and work effort involved to implement 

## Align
***
### Tier 1:
1. **Arts Advisory Group for Sacramento**: Launch a collective impact model with the senior leadership representing the districts, the city, the arts nonprofits, and the community. This collaborative should follow the five pillars of effective collective impact: 1) create a shared agenda and purpose; 2) identify common progress measures and outcome-focused metrics; 3) design mutually-reinforcing activities; 4) create a clear, regular, and transparent process for communication; and 5) fund a backbone organization to serve as a facilitator and manager of the collaborative.

2. **Student Seat on SMAC**: Create a permanent student seat on the SMAC Board of Commissioners, available to an 8th-12th grader who can provide the student perspective to the commission and play an active role in shaping arts education in the region.

3. **Center for Arts Education (Maker Lab / Creativity Center), focused on hands on exposure**: Create a brick-and-mortar physical center dedicated to arts education in the Sacramento region. Make the center available for school field trips, art education workshops and classes, camps, art nights, galleries, and art exploration through multiple mediums. 

### Tier 2:
1. **Arts Providers Advisory Group**: Create an advisory group wherein each art provider organization in the area is represented. Ideally, this group should meet regularly (monthly or quarterly) in order to keep everyone apprised of the latest happenings and efforts in their respective organizations. In addition, the advisory group would serve as a platform to identify potential redundancies and opportunities for greater collaboration.

2. **Public space for student art**: A permanent, high-traffic public area that can showcase student art. This city is so great at showcasing artists through public art and murals, so it’d be great to see students included in that movement, and it would inspire other students.

### Tier 3:
1. **Improve communications**: Create a bare-bones way for arts providers and schools to stay up-to-date on the area’s offerings and efforts, such as a Facebook page, a newsletter, etc.

2. **Consistent channel for student voice & feedback**: Create a process or platform by which to capture student voice and feedback. This could be as simple as a wiki or annual survey.

3. **Student Showcase**: Partner with organizations and/or institutions with available space to allow students to present their art. Consider a rotating model with multiple locations.

## Leverage
***
### Tier 1:
1. **Arts Lead at every school and at every district**: Hire a dedicated arts lead for each of the five districts in the region, as well as for each school within those districts. The district level arts leads will be responsible for organizing the various offerings in the region and securing the necessary funding (pushing art into the schools); each school-level arts lead will be responsible for advocating for his/her school and bringing specific projects in (pulling art into the school).

2. **Art Ed Yelp**: Build a digital platform that allows principals, teachers, students and parents to rate various arts providers and programs. The goal here is to add a lens of quality to what’s out there, in that not all arts providers offer the same level of quality or service. Having this rating will allow principals/teachers/parents/students to more knowledgeably access and advocate for high-quality arts programming and hold programs accountable for quality.

### Tier 2:
1. **Arts Lead Cluster Model**: Hire a dedicated arts lead for each of the five school districts in the region and one arts lead at the school-level for every 5-7 schools (school cluster). This is a scaled down version of the top recommendation under “Leverage”— instead of having a dedicated arts lead for each school, every grouping of 5-7 schools will share one arts lead.

2. **Arts Supply & Provider Inventory**: Create a centralized list of all arts providers in the region, including a profile for each provider that outlines programs offered, schedules, partnership details, and contact information. Similarly, create a centralized list of all art supplies in the district, which will allow schools to better share existing arts resources.

3. **Transportation for students**: Transportation was identified as a significant hurdle as to why schools couldn’t access all the arts opportunities they wanted. Increase funding for school buses for the most underserved schools.
 
### Tier 3:
1. **Arts Lead at every district**: Expand the current model and hire a dedicated arts lead for each of the five districts. Consider too seeking a volunteer among current staff at each school to be the designated “art lead” (the go-to person for all things art related at that school). This will be the person a district-level arts lead can contact, and someone who can coordinate with outside arts providers. Note that at the school-level, this “art lead” will not be a full-time position, but rather would function similarly to how a club sponsor would function.

2. **Provider inventory**: Create a centralized list of all arts providers in the region (with info about what they offer and their contact info). 

3. **Targeted outreach to underserved**: Some of the most underserved schools might need more support to know what arts education options are available and how to access them.

## Learn
***
### Tier 1:
1. **Arts Ed Study mission**: Organize arts providers, principals, arts leads, etc. for a trip to a city demonstrating best practices to learn and see first-hand how they do what they do with arts education.

2. **Partnership w/ major regional arts organizations (philharmonics, ballets, artists, etc.) for arts mentorship to district and school arts leads**: Build mentorships between the region’s top arts organizations and each district, helping each district shape its art offering and gain access to the region’s best art minds and offerings. For example, the Executive Director of the Sacramento Philharmonic and Opera could help mentor the arts lead for Twin Rivers, helping the district think creatively about how to access the various arts offerings in the region.

## Tier 2:
1. **Sister schools**: Within each district, create pairs of schools to learn from one another’s efforts regarding arts education. Tap the schools with the strongest arts education programs to serve as mentors to a sister school with struggling arts education programs.

2. **Partnership w/local community college & university for arts mentorship to underserved classrooms**: Collaborate with local community colleges, CSU Sacramento, and UC Davis to create a mentorship program between aspiring artists and arts educators to underserved K-12 schools.

3. **Grant writing training**: Provide grant writing training to arts leads in order to better equip them to secure arts education funding. Consider partnering with an outside expert to provide the training.


### Tier 3:
1. **Centralized repository of best practices**: Curate and maintain a centralized database of arts education best practices (in the region and in the field in general). This database would have empirical studies, lesson plans, teaching techniques, etc.

2. **Local artists brought in for guest presentations to students to increase arts exposure**: Recruit artists and bring them into schools on a regular basis to increase arts exposure for students, especially at underserved schools. 

3. **Raise awareness of arts education needs and opportunities**: On the Mayor’s website, share the data regarding where the Sacramento-area districts are in regards to providing quality arts education and share best practices for Sacramento schools and communities.
