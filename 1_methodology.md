## Methodology


The following methodologies were used to conduct research and collect data:

Secondary Research

To understand the local, regional and national landscape, secondary research was conducted with a focus on:

Surveys

Quantitative surveys were designed for two separate audiences in order to fully assess K-6th arts education in schools:

Principals for all   schools within the five identified school districts:

We asked for superintendent support in distributing the survey to principals. Alongside our call for survey completion, we also included a letter from the Mayor’s office underscoring the importance of this survey for the purposes of understanding the current landscape in local K-6th arts education.

Non-profit arts organizations:

This survey was sent directly to points of contact that were pulled from the Sacramento Region Community Foundation database labeled as Executive Directors of Arts organizations in Sacramento County. This data was intended to provide us with a more complete picture of available arts opportunities in the region, including whether or not school sites were effectively leveraging outside arts education opportunities and if so / not why that was the case. 

Interviews

One-on-one interviews were conducted with two members of the arts and/or education community for in depth discovery.

Design Thinking Session

The design-thinking ideology asserts that a hands-on, user-centric approach to problem solving can lead to innovation and building effective solutions. This hands-on, user-centric approach is defined by the design-thinking process and comprises 6 distinct phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test, and implement. By invite, a Design Thinking session was held on Saturday, April 22, 2017 led by Human Centered Design expert, George Claire (The Shop @ VSP Global) and was attended by several representatives from various groups, including: students, educators, arts educators and artists. The challenge to tackle for the groups was: “How Might We Bring Art To Every Child”.




<!--
This play will include a numeric score card that will assess a Department's current assets and capabilities—including technology and human resources–to leverage their data to help formulate program or policy solutions.

* What data do you currently collect?
* What technology can you leverage?
* What data analytics tools do you have available within the Department or Agency?
* What established processes can you leverage?

The goal is to look at existing capabilities to address the problems or issues outlined.

The capability assessment will help facilitate a conversation within the Department  to help catalog the various resources available in order to address the problems identified in the objective assessment.

>Assess the Department's readiness by **identifying the gaps and needs** in order to operationalize the data strategy.

1. How do **programs or stakeholders** use data currently? What do they do with it? How do they use it to make decisions or produce products for external stakeholders?
2. What are **limits** to either the data or the implementation solution?
3. What are the **risks/issues** with the current data? What value is not being realized?
4. Identify the current workflow for **collecting, processing, and publishing** data. Are there dependencies to collecting, processing, and publishing the data?

>To give an even deeper look at these strategies, Departments share how they’ve put them to use in different scenarios and for different efforts.
