The following methodologies were used to conduct research and collect data:

## Secondary Research
To understand the local, regional and national landscape, secondary research was conducted with a focus on:

* Quality and Quantity of Arts Education
* The Gold Standard
* Arts Education Vs. Arts Exposure
* Arts Education Throughout CA and Other Cities

## Surveys

Quantitative surveys were designed for two separate audiences in order to fully assess K-6th arts education in schools:

**Principals for all schools within the five identified school districts:**
We asked for superintendent support in distributing the survey to principals. Alongside our call for survey completion, we also included a letter from the Mayor’s office underscoring the importance of this survey for the purposes of understanding the current landscape in local K-6th arts education.

**Non-profit arts organizations:**
This survey was sent directly to points of contact that were pulled from the Sacramento Region Community Foundation database labeled as Executive Directors of Arts organizations in Sacramento County. This data was intended to provide us with a more complete picture of available arts opportunities in the region, including whether or not school sites were effectively leveraging outside arts education opportunities and if so / not why that was the case. 

## Interviews

One-on-one interviews were conducted with two members of the arts and/or education community for in depth discovery.

## Design Thinking Sessions

The design-thinking ideology asserts that a hands-on, user-centric approach to problem solving can lead to innovation and building effective solutions. This hands-on, user-centric approach is defined by the design-thinking process and comprises 6 distinct phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test, and implement. By invite, a Design Thinking session was held on Saturday, April 22, 2017 led by Human Centered Design expert, George Claire (The Shop @ VSP Global) and was attended by several representatives from various groups, including: students, educators, arts educators and artists. The challenge to tackle for the groups was: **“How Might We Bring Art To Every Child”**.
