## Secondary Research


Overall, there is research that shows that arts education is in-line with 21st Century Learning Outcomes. These outcomes include: an integrated approach to learning/teaching; innovative skills building; creativity and critical thinking skills and collaboration. It is important to note that the research only shows correlations between arts education and academic achievement. It does not show causation.

Quality of arts education

Quality arts education can best be understood by dissecting the experience into four components, each of which has key indicators for quality:

• Student Learning – what students are actually doing in the classroom, the kinds of projects and tasks they’re involved in, the focus and character of their engagement, the attitudes and mindsets they bring to the learning experience.
o Engagement
o Purposeful experiences creating or engaging with works of art o Emotional openness and honesty
o Experimentation, exploration, and inquiry
o Ownership

• Pedagogy – how teachers conceive of and practice their craft, how they conceptualize their role in the classroom, and how they design and implement instruction.
o Authenticity
o Modeling artistic processes, inquiry, and habits
o Participation in the learning experience
o Making learning relevant and connected to prior knowledge o Intentionality, flexibility, and transparency

• Community Dynamics – the social dimension of the relationships in the classroom or other arts learning setting, relationships among the students themselves, between students and teachers, and among the teachers and other adults who interact with students in the classroom.
o Respect and trust among all participants, along with a belief in student capacities o Open communication
o Collaboration

• Environment – the tangible and concrete elements, including the physical space of the classroom, the material resources available, as well as the time students are given (hours and years) to engage in arts learning.
o Functional and aesthetic space and materials
o The arts occupy a central place in the physical environment o Sufficient time for authentic artistic work
   Commented [SC2]: Think that the secondary research and survey results need a bit more organizing and downsizing.
Results
 
Quantity of Arts Education (Is this it for this section?)

Stats for Sacramento:
• 138 schools
• 111,498 enrolled
• 38,238 arts enrollment
• 34% arts
• 818 arts teachers, 139.3 (student/teacher ratio)

The Gold Standard (Need more details)

According to the California VAPA Framework, a balanced, comprehensive arts program is "one in which the arts are studied as discrete disciplines related to each other and, when appropriate, to other subject areas in the curriculum." A comprehensive arts program has key elements that allow students to develop competencies in the art disciplines while also maintaining high standards for success. T o master the standards of an arts discipline, the framework states that comprehensive arts programs should be built around 5 strands:
a. Artistic perception. Students use language and the skills unique to visual arts, theater, dance and music to analyze and respond to sensory information.
b. Creative expression. This deals with the application of the skills learned in the arts disciplines. Students create and/or perform their own work. They also communicate the intent of meaning of their work.
c. Historical and cultural context. In learning an art discipline, the students work towards understanding the historical and cultural contributions within the discipline.
d. Aesthetic valuing. Students learn to critically assess and derive meaning. This includes their own and from original works within the discipline. In this way, they learn to critique works of dance, music, theatre and the visual arts.
e. Connections, relationships, and applications. Making connections of one art discipline to other arts is vital to a comprehensive arts program. By making these connections, students “develop competencies and creative skills in problem solving, communication, and time management that contribute to lifelong learning, including career skills.”

Arts Education vs. Art Exposure

Ultimately, one is a by-product of the other. Countless research studies and documentation not only suggest but prove that learning outcomes dramatically increase with exposure to the arts. The phenomenon should be viewed holistically rather dissected. It’s not either or: arts education or arts exposure. For maximum impact, they walk in hand in hand.
     
ARTS EDUCATION

Overview

• Arts education solves problems. Years of research show that it's closely linked to academic
achievement, social and emotional development, civic engagement, and equitable
opportunity.

Americans for the Arts

• Research shows impressive benefits of arts education on entire school culture especially
student motivation, attitudes, and attendance. Numerous reports discuss the ways that increased access and involvement in arts education encourage students to stay in school, succeed in school, succeed in life, and succeed in work.

Edutopia

• Involvement in the arts is associated with gains in math, reading, cognitive ability, critical
thinking, and verbal skill. Daily Signal
• In response to Obama’s “Educate to Innovate” campaign, which included funding for more than 100k STEM teachers over the next decade, academic leaders agreed that “A” for “arts and humanities” should be added to create STEAM education. Arts and humanities are just as an important dimension of educating students as are science, technology, engineering, and math.

ARTS EXPOSURE

Overview

• Exposure equals Access. Culturally enriching experiences like the arts, not only produce
educational benefits, but promote major gains in children’s confidence, persistence, collaboration,
motivation, tolerance, empathy, and a greater sense of community. The Daily Signal
• Once the great equalizer in terms of access to arts and culture in public schools, cultural field trips were viewed as central to a school’s educational mission. With continued budget cuts and lack of funding, less-advantaged students are less likely to have these experiences, while more advantaged families expose their children to cultural institutions and experiences outside of school hours. When give access to art exposure, students from rural or high-poverty areas often have reported higher levels of historical recall, desire, and interest.
Edutopia
• From Mozart for babies, to tutus for toddlers, to family trips to the museum, children of affluent,
aspiring parents generally get exposed to the arts whether or not public schools provide them. Low-income children, often, do not. Strong arts programming in schools helps close a gap that has left many a child behind. Access equals a more level playing field with children who have enrichment experiences and opportunities.
Huffington Post
• Arts exposure or access at a very young age fosters creativity, encourages tolerance of diverse
populations, and promotes use of creative outlets for expressing emotions.
Arts Education Throughout California and other Cities (Need more meat in summary)


<!--
This play will include a numeric score card that will assess a Department's current assets and capabilities—including technology and human resources–to leverage their data to help formulate program or policy solutions.

* What data do you currently collect?
* What technology can you leverage?
* What data analytics tools do you have available within the Department or Agency?
* What established processes can you leverage?

The goal is to look at existing capabilities to address the problems or issues outlined.

The capability assessment will help facilitate a conversation within the Department  to help catalog the various resources available in order to address the problems identified in the objective assessment.

>Assess the Department's readiness by **identifying the gaps and needs** in order to operationalize the data strategy.

![CHHS Governance Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/00_figure05.png "CHHS Governance Resources")

1. How do **programs or stakeholders** use data currently? What do they do with it? How do they use it to make decisions or produce products for external stakeholders?
2. What are **limits** to either the data or the implementation solution?
3. What are the **risks/issues** with the current data? What value is not being realized?
4. Identify the current workflow for **collecting, processing, and publishing** data. Are there dependencies to collecting, processing, and publishing the data?

![How do you assess readiness?]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/02_figure01.png "How do you assess readiness?")

>To give an even deeper look at these strategies, Departments share how they’ve put them to use in different scenarios and for different efforts.
