## Tier 1:
1. **Arts Advisory Group for Sacramento**: Launch a collective impact model with the senior leadership representing the districts, the city, the arts nonprofits, and the community. This collaborative should follow the five pillars of effective collective impact: 1) create a shared agenda and purpose; 2) identify common progress measures and outcome-focused metrics; 3) design mutually-reinforcing activities; 4) create a clear, regular, and transparent process for communication; and 5) fund a backbone organization to serve as a facilitator and manager of the collaborative.

2. **Student Seat on SMAC**: Create a permanent student seat on the SMAC Board of Commissioners, available to an 8th-12th grader who can provide the student perspective to the commission and play an active role in shaping arts education in the region.

3. **Center for Arts Education (Maker Lab / Creativity Center), focused on hands on exposure**: Create a brick-and-mortar physical center dedicated to arts education in the Sacramento region. Make the center available for school field trips, art education workshops and classes, camps, art nights, galleries, and art exploration through multiple mediums. 

## Tier 2:
1. **Arts Providers Advisory Group**: Create an advisory group wherein each art provider organization in the area is represented. Ideally, this group should meet regularly (monthly or quarterly) in order to keep everyone apprised of the latest happenings and efforts in their respective organizations. In addition, the advisory group would serve as a platform to identify potential redundancies and opportunities for greater collaboration.

2. **Public space for student art**: A permanent, high-traffic public area that can showcase student art. This city is so great at showcasing artists through public art and murals, so it’d be great to see students included in that movement, and it would inspire other students.

## Tier 3:
1. **Improve communications**: Create a bare-bones way for arts providers and schools to stay up-to-date on the area’s offerings and efforts, such as a Facebook page, a newsletter, etc.

2. **Consistent channel for student voice & feedback**: Create a process or platform by which to capture student voice and feedback. This could be as simple as a wiki or annual survey.

3. **Student Showcase**: Partner with organizations and/or institutions with available space to allow students to present their art. Consider a rotating model with multiple locations.
