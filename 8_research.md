## NELP Arts Assessment Research Summary

### Research on arts impact on academic achievement

There is substantial research showing the positive effects of arts education on academic achievement, in particular for students from low SES backgrounds. This was shown in school with high arts participation and what they call arts rich schools: schools with a complete arts curriculum.

Some research discussed arts integration. This is where arts in infused across the curriculum. In schools that had both an arts class and arts integrated across the curriculum, the students outperformed others in schools focused primarily on one or the other. Teachers in these settings were also given more professional development which contributed to the positive effects on student achievement. It was also suggested that extensive and deep involvement in arts activities showed a significant predictor of students later achievement and community involvement. Arts education had prosocial outcomes notwithstanding the positive effects on student achievement.

Overall, there is research that shows that arts education is in-line with 21st Century Learning Outcomes. These outcomes include: an integrated approach to learning/teaching; innovative skills building; creativity and critical thinking skills and collaboration. It is important to note that the research only shows correlations between arts education and academic achievement. It does not show causation.

The Qualities of Quality: Understanding Excellence in Arts Education
http://www.wallacefoundation.org/knowledge-center/Documents/Understanding-Excellence-in-Arts- Education.pdf
Quality arts education can best be understood by dissecting the experience into four components, each of which has key indicators for quality:
  
 ● Student Learning – what students are actually doing in the classroom, the kinds of projects and tasks they’re involved in, the focus and character of their engagement, the attitudes and mindsets they bring

● Respect and trust among all participants, along with a belief in student capacities
● Open communication
● Collaboration
● Environment – the tangible and concrete elements, including the physical space of the classroom, the material resources available, as well as the time students are given (hours and years) to engage in arts learning.
● Functional and aesthetic space and materials
● The arts occupy a central place in the physical environment
● Sufficient time for authentic artistic work

 Bucket 3 - Arts Education Vs. Arts Exposure
ARTS EDUCATION
Overview
Americans for the Arts
Edutopia
Involvement in the arts is associated with gains in math, reading, cognitive ability, critical thinking, and verbal skill.
Daily Signal
ARTS EXPOSURE
Overview
The Daily Signal
 Ultimately, one is a by-product of the other. Countless research studies and documentation not only suggest but
 prove that learning outcomes dramatically increase with exposure to the arts. The phenomenon should be viewed
 holistically rather dissected. It’s not either or: arts education or arts exposure. For maximum impact, they walk in
 hand in hand.
 However, for the purposes of our project, we must acknowledge the difference between the two so that we may
 focus on the core purpose, benefits, value, and importance of consistent arts education programs for K-8 grade
 students.
   Arts education solves problems. Years of research show that it's closely linked to academic achievement, social and
 emotional development, civic engagement, and equitable opportunity.
   Research shows impressive benefits of arts education on entire school culture—especially student motivation,
 attitudes, and attendance. Numerous reports discuss the ways that increased access and involvement in arts
 education encourage students to stay in school, succeed in school, succeed in life, and succeed in work.
      In response to Obama’s “Educate to Innovate campaign, which included funding for more than 100k STEM
 teachers over the next decade, academic leaders agreed that “A” for “arts and humanities” should be added to
 create STEAM education.
 Arts and humanities are just as an important dimension of educating students as are science, technology,
 engineering, and math.
   Exposure equals Access. Culturally enriching experiences like the arts, not only produce educational benefits, but
 promote major gains in children’s confidence, persistence, collaboration, motivation, tolerance, empathy, and a
 greater sense of community.
   Once the great equalizer in terms of access to arts and culture in public schools, cultural field trips were viewed as
 central to a school’s educational mission. With continued budget cuts and lack of funding, less-advantaged
 students are less likely to have these experiences, while more advantaged families expose their children to cultural
 institutions and experiences outside of school hours.
 When give access to art exposure, students from rural or high-poverty areas often have reported higher levels of
 historical recall, desire, and interest.

  Edutopia
Access equals a more level playing field with children who have enrichment experiences and opportunities.

2009 Washington State and Washington State Arts Commission Study
  From Mozart for babies, to tutus for toddlers, to family trips to the museum, children of affluent, aspiring parents
 generally get exposed to the arts whether or not public schools provide them.
 Low-income children, often, do not. Strong arts programming in schools helps close a gap that has left many a child
 behind.
    Arts exposure or access at a very young age fosters creativity, encourages tolerance of diverse populations, and
 promotes use of creative outlets for expressing emotions.

 The pdf report summarizes their design and methodology. This is where they felt there were gaps. Most likely
 since it was all quantitative research (surveys). Supplementing with qualitative research is where they feel we will
 gain the missing information (the principal interviews) and be able to tell the whole story.
               
 CASE STUDY ASSESSMENT: Los Angeles USD
The goal was to identify two cities that implemented arts in education programs as case studies to prove or negate effectiveness or challenges.
The guiding principle for major school districts like Los Angeles and San Francisco is that all students deserve both access to and equity in arts education.
Los Angeles USD
The nation’s largest school district, all LAUSD students are exposed to the arts—during the school day. The district even has a dedicated Arts Education Branch. In addition to funding, resources are supplemented by partnerships, fundraising, and local volunteer artists.
Arts Equity Index
An Arts Equity Index (AEI) is used to ensure that under-served students and schools receive an increased level of arts support and services. http://laschoolboard.org/sites/default/files/Tab1MeetingMaterial-LargeDownload.pdf
The Arts Equity Index assigns levels for all LAUSD schools K-12 based on the scope of their provided arts instruction, resources, and Student Equity Index. The AEI index levels are:
1. Non-Existent 2. Basic
3. Emerging
4. Developing 5. Strong
6. Excelling
A school’s Arts Equity Index level is determined through a short electronic survey completed by a principal (or designee) that assesses where and how arts resources and supplies are being used in a school.
HOW DOES THE ARTS EQUITY INDEX (AEI) BENEFIT SCHOOLS?
The goal is for all LAUSD schools to be at a Level 4 (Developing) or higher within three years. Each school year, steps are taken to provide more equity of arts resource allocation based on the assigned level, and to insure that all students have appropriate arts access and instruction.
WHAT RESOURCES WILL BE PROVIDED TO UNDER-RESOURCED SCHOOLS?
• Additional Arts Teachers
 
• Additional supplies, materials, and equipment
• Externally secured funding and in-kind support
• Strategic Community Arts Partner usage
• Expanded Instructional Time Options (0 & 7 period classes)
• Creative Network
• Title I
MIXED RESULTS
In 2012, Los Angeles Unified school board members made arts instruction a core subject, designating it as important as subjects like math and English. The move was aimed at getting the arts to every student in the district, and it won applause from arts supporters around the country. But in 2015, the goal of universal arts instruction remains elusive. A KPCC analysis of the most recent district data found that at about 100 elementary schools, the vast majority of students get no arts instruction.
Still, across the district, there are signs of improvement. Forty-five new art teachers were hired for the new school year, according to district numbers, and resources like professional development for teachers have been increased. Plus, the district's arts branch launched a series of arts festivals that showcase student work.
• The AEI attributed to results
• Showed a wide disparity among schools in the amount of instruction in the arts
• Funding was redistributed to provide instruction where it was needed the most

#### 1. CHHS De-Identification Guidelines

The CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines describe a procedure to be used by departments and offices in the Agency to assess data for public release. As part of the guidelines, specific actions that may be taken for each step in the procedure are described. These steps are intended to assist departments in assuring that data is de-identified for purposes of public release that meet the requirements of the California Information Practices Act (IPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to prevent the disclosure of personal information.  

The CHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines are focused on the assessment of aggregate or summary data for purposes of de-identification and public release.  Aggregate data means collective data that relates to a group or category of services or individuals. The aggregate data may be shown in table form as counts, percentages, rates, averages, or other statistical groupings.
