## NELP Arts Assessment Research Summary

### Research on arts impact on academic achievement

There is substantial research showing the positive effects of arts education on academic achievement, in particular for students from low SES backgrounds. This was shown in school with high arts participation and what they call arts rich schools: schools with a complete arts curriculum.

Some research discussed arts integration. This is where arts in infused across the curriculum. In schools that had both an arts class and arts integrated across the curriculum, the students outperformed others in schools focused primarily on one or the other. Teachers in these settings were also given more professional development which contributed to the positive effects on student achievement. It was also suggested that extensive and deep involvement in arts activities showed a significant predictor of students later achievement and community involvement. Arts education had prosocial outcomes notwithstanding the positive effects on student achievement.

Overall, there is research that shows that arts education is in-line with 21st Century Learning Outcomes. These outcomes include: an integrated approach to learning/teaching; innovative skills building; creativity and critical thinking skills and collaboration. It is important to note that the research only shows correlations between arts education and academic achievement. It does not show causation.

### Research Requirement Buckets

1. Quality and Quantity of Arts Education
  * What’s already happening, where, how often/how many hours,
  * Mandated by district or school driven
  
2. The Gold Standard
  * What it is and examples that already exist
  * Best practices, min threshold of hours
  
3. Arts Education Vs. Arts Exposure

4. Arts Education Throughout CA and Other Cities
  * For schools/districts with strong arts programs, how have these schools/districts changed? What outcomes are they seeing?
  * What hurdles have others run into when building out arts education programs in schools?
  * How do the Sacramento-area districts vary in what arts education they offer?
  
### Bucket 1a - Quality

**The Qualities of Quality: Understanding Excellence in Arts Education**
http://www.wallacefoundation.org/knowledge-center/Documents/Understanding-Excellence-in-Arts-Education.pdf

Quality arts education can best be understood by dissecting **the experience** into four components, each of which has key indicators for quality:
  
1. **Student Learning**: – what students are actually doing in the classroom, the kinds of projects and tasks they’re involved in, the focus and character of their engagement, the attitudes and mindsets they bring to the learning experience. 
  * Engagement
  * Purposeful experiences creating or engaging with works of art
  * Emotional openness and honesty
  * Experimentation, exploration, and inquiry 
  * Ownership

2. **Pedagogy**: how teachers conceive of and practice their craft, how they conceptualize their role in the classroom, and how they design and implement instruction. 
  * Authenticity
  * Modeling artistic processes, inquiry, and habits 
  * Participation in the learning experience
  * Making learning relevant and connected to prior knowledge 
  * Intentionality, flexibility, and transparency 
  
3. **Community Dynamics**: the social dimension of the relationships in the classroom or other arts learning setting, relationships among the students themselves, between students and teachers, and among the teachers and other adults who interact with students in the classroom.
  * Respect and trust among all participants, along with a belief in student capacities 
  * Open communication 
  * Collaboration
  
4. **Environment**: – the tangible and concrete elements, including the physical space of the classroom, the material resources available, as well as the time students are given (hours and years) to engage in arts learning.
  * Functional and aesthetic space and materials
  * The arts occupy a central place in the physical environment
  * Sufficient time for authentic artistic work

### Bucket 1b - Quantity

### Bucket 2 - The Gold Standard

Comprehensive arts programs according to California VAPA framework
http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/documents/vpaframewrk.pdf

1. Artistic perception
2. Creative expression
3. Historical and cultural context
4. Aesthetic valuing
5. Connections, relationships, and applications

### Bucket 3 - Arts Education Vs. Arts Exposure

Ultimately, one is a by-product of the other. Countless research studies and documentation not only suggest but
prove that learning outcomes dramatically increase with exposure to the arts. The phenomenon should be viewed
holistically rather dissected. It’s not either or: arts education or arts exposure. For maximum impact, they walk in
hand in hand.

However, for the purposes of our project, we must acknowledge the difference between the two so that we may
focus on the core purpose, benefits, value, and importance of consistent arts education programs for K-8 grade
students.

**ARTS EDUCATION**

*Overview*
Arts education solves problems. Years of research show that it's closely linked to academic achievement, social and
emotional development, civic engagement, and equitable opportunity.

*Americans for the Arts*
Research shows impressive benefits of arts education on entire school culture—especially student motivation,
attitudes, and attendance. Numerous reports discuss the ways that increased access and involvement in arts
education encourage students to stay in school, succeed in school, succeed in life, and succeed in work.

*Edutopia*
Involvement in the arts is associated with gains in math, reading, cognitive ability, critical thinking, and verbal skill.

*Daily Signal*
In response to Obama’s “Educate to Innovate campaign, which included funding for more than 100k STEM
teachers over the next decade, academic leaders agreed that “A” for “arts and humanities” should be added to
create STEAM education.

Arts and humanities are just as an important dimension of educating students as are science, technology,
engineering, and math.

**ARTS EXPOSURE**

*Overview*
Exposure equals Access. Culturally enriching experiences like the arts, not only produce educational benefits, but
promote major gains in children’s confidence, persistence, collaboration, motivation, tolerance, empathy, and a
greater sense of community.

*The Daily Signal*
Once the great equalizer in terms of access to arts and culture in public schools, cultural field trips were viewed as
central to a school’s educational mission. With continued budget cuts and lack of funding, less-advantaged
students are less likely to have these experiences, while more advantaged families expose their children to cultural
institutions and experiences outside of school hours.

When give access to art exposure, students from rural or high-poverty areas often have reported higher levels of
historical recall, desire, and interest.

*Edutopia*
From Mozart for babies, to tutus for toddlers, to family trips to the museum, children of affluent, aspiring parents
generally get exposed to the arts whether or not public schools provide them.

Low-income children, often, do not. Strong arts programming in schools helps close a gap that has left many a child
behind.

Access equals a more level playing field with children who have enrichment experiences and opportunities.

*Huffington Post*
Arts exposure or access at a very young age fosters creativity, encourages tolerance of diverse populations, and
promotes use of creative outlets for expressing emotions

**2009 Washington State and Washington State Arts Commission Study**
All Washington K–12 principals were invited to participate in an online survey about arts education in their schools.
A total of 478 principals participated, providing information about curriculum, funding, and other factors that
impact teaching and learning in the arts. Here is a manifesto that they created that tells a story and presents an
action plan.

**Kennedy Center Information**
The pdf report summarizes their design and methodology. This is where they felt there were gaps. Most likely
since it was all quantitative research (surveys). Supplementing with qualitative research is where they feel we will
gain the missing information (the principal interviews) and be able to tell the whole story.
