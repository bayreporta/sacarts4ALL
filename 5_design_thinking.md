# Design Thinking Sessions

As a part of our assessment journey we heard some powerful and very moving stories about the
value of arts education as well as the gaps and needs observed in this space. The goal of our
assessment and discovery was to tell a story and highlight useful recommendations and solutions
that fit and address the needs of our stakeholders. That made us wonder, what if we put the arts
education stakeholders at the center of the process. What would happen if we brought these
stakeholders together and asked them to not only highlight the gaps but also identify
Opportunities and help us build solutions?

We put together a Design Thinking workshop where we brought together leaders, stakeholders,
non-profits and recipients of arts education and asked them to imagine a future that includes a
deeper commitment to the arts in schools in Sacramento region and build solutions that will take
us there. Challenging them with the question of: “How might we bring art to every child?”.
Throughout the 4-hour process, the four teams made lots of discoveries, as outlined below: 

## Ideation: “What Art Means to Me”
During the first part of the session we asked attendees to participate in Poll everywhere
interactive survey exercise and enter a word, or multiple words that describe what art means to
them. The participants used their mobile phones to make the submissions. Based on the words
that were submitted, the word cloud was automatically produced. The words that appear bigger
in size are the words that were submitted more frequently.

Following this exercise we asked participants to create a drawing that captures what art means to
them in a visual form. The drawings were then pinned at the wall and we asked the participants
to share with the group what their drawing represents.

## Prototyping solutions: “How Might We Bring Art To Every Child”
During the second part of the workshop we asked participants to ideate range of creative ideas
that address solutions to how they might bring art to every child. Team members shared their
ideas with one another, mixing and remixing, and building on each others' ideas.

After narrowing down to their preferred ideas each team built a real, tactile prototype of their
proposed solution. Each team then pitched their solution to another team and asked for feedback.
Based on the feedback they received teams were able to iterate on their solution one last time
before the final presentations.

At the end of the Design Thinking workshop each group pitched their solution to the entire
group. Here is a short description of the four solutions that our teams envisioned and built
prototypes around:

1. **Art week:** A concept for “An Art week” in each district where all students showcase an art
they learned.

2. **Art App:** A concept for an app that serves as inventory of tools and resources and facilitates
matchmaking and discussion between Art Seekers and Art Providers.

3. **Art Playground:** A concept for a space where students can do art (all genres). This space
gives all students an opportunity to interact with art and be creative. The group also discussed
management of such space.

4. **Art Integration:** The idea is to have a way that all students are exposed to all/variety of
genres of art. Artist in residence could be leveraged to achieve this or art instructors could rotate
to classes/schools. Emphasis: Every child would be included no regardless of their artistic ability
or achievement levels.
